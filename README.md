 As part of a data analytics project, I conducted a comprehensive year-over-year (YoY) analysis of monthly financial collections spanning a five-year period (2021 to 2025). The project involved comparing collection data across all 12 calendar months for each year to identify performance trends, detect seasonal patterns, and measure growth.

Through this analysis, I was able to:

    Track and visualize monthly collection fluctuations across years.
    Identify recurring seasonal trends that influence revenue performance.
    Highlight consistent growth in collections, signaling positive organizational progress.
    Provide actionable insights to support financial planning and decision-making.

The project demonstrated my ability to manage multi-year datasets, extract meaningful patterns, and translate data into strategic recommendations for business improvement.
